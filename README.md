# WebApp-Equipamentos-HOB
WebApp developed in Google App Scripts, using React as the frontend framework, to share manuals and other equipment documents.

### Why use Google App Scripts and Google Sheets as a database?
Simply put, it was just easier on everybody else. Using Sheets was already pretty estabilished in the workflow when this webapp was created, so it was just easier to leave it as the main way of adding new items. Besides that, maintenance would be a huge problem since I was the only one in the hospital comfortable enough to code and solve any problems that could show up. In case I left and nobody could fix the problem, people could just keep using Google Sheets, as always.
